# Double Pendulum Simulation
https://yoda-flash.github.io/double-pendulum-sim/


A simulation of a double pendulum, for Hack Club Accelerate!

*Note: If the alpha and omega values reach infinity, the simulation will reset to a random theta value and 0 omega, and start again.

## How To Use
Start by dragging either pendulum to an angle, and let go for the double pendulum to start moving!
For better clarity, you can move the origin around as well.

Observe how the values on the menu change as time goes on. 

## Playing, Pausing, Restarting, and More!
The UI features a bar at the bottom where you can play or pause the animation, 
move the system to up to 10 timesteps back and revert that, or reset all the settings.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Space: Toggle play and pause
Left arrow: Rewind 1 timestep
Right arrow: Move forward 1 timestep (only works if you previously rewinded! Otherwise, just press play.)
R: Reset to initial position

## Further Customization
Open up the menu bar to make further customizations!

### Mode
There are 3 modes: Normal, Food, and Galactic.
Press the "Mode" button to cycle through the options!

#### Normal
The pendulums are regular ball shapes, colored by a gradient.

#### Food
The pendulums appear as different food items, which are randomly generated from a list of art drawn by me. 
Check the assets folder if you want to see them all!

#### Galactic
The pendulums appear as different planets, which are also randomly generated from a list of art drawn by me.
Check the assets folder if you want to see them all!

### Trail
There are 5 different trail settings: None, Particle, Particles, Streak, and Streaks.
Press the "Trail" button to cycle through the options!

#### Particle
A fading trail made of a single line of particles.

#### Particles
A fading trail made of a group of particles, which scatter based on their own speeds.

#### Streak
A fading trail made of a single line.

#### Streaks
A fading trail made of a group of streaks, which scatter based on their own speeds, like a meteor shower.
